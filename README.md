# Selenium-TestNG-Framework

This framework is updated to support Selenium 4.15 <br>
I made updates only to the LoginTest Class (located in 'testcases' package)
- All test cases are functioning within the class, and all tests pass.

You can make changes (updates) to other test case classes as needed.

_**The framework is pointing to a new URL because the old URL is no longer working._**

**What is new in this version:**

- Updated to the latest version of Selenium which is 4.15.0 as of this git push.
- No separate installation of webdrivers required anymore (yay! ðŸŽ‰) <br>
- ~~Removed~~ Kept 'drivers' folder in case you want to use local drivers (but no longer needed, safe to delete it)
- Removed WebDriverManager dependency from the POM <br>
- Updated some web locators (pointing to new URL)

To run tests from the command line within the Intellij, pass the following line to IntelliJ Terminal:<br>
***mvn test -Dfilename=smoke.xml***

**Notes:** New URL randomly switches to Spanish language by default. If this happens, test validations will fail since they are written to validate English version of the website.<br>

If this happens, here are instructions on how to fix it:
1. Login to the website using valid credentials
2. On the top left side main menu click on the Admin menu
3. Then on the Admin page, top left sub-menu find the 'Configuration' menu and click on it, it's a drop-down menu
4. From the Configuration's drop-down select 'Localization' option
5. From the Language drop-down field, select English and Save, and exit.
