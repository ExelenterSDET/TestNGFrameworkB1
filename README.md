# Selenium-TestNG-Framework

This framework is updated to support Selenium 4.15
I made updates only to LoginTest Class (located in 'testcases' package)
 - All test cases are functioning within the class, all tests pass.

You can make changes (updates) to other test case classes as needed.

_**The framework is pointing to new URL, because old URL is no longer working._**

**What is new in this version:**

- Updated to latest version of Selenium which is 4.15.0 as of this git push. 
- No separate installation of webdrivers required anymore (yay! ðŸŽ‰) <br>
- ~~Removed~~ Kept 'drivers' folder in case if you want to use local drivers (but no longer needed, safe to delete it)
- Removed WebDriverManager dependency from the POM <br>
- Updated some web locators (pointing to new URL)

**Notes:** New URL randomly switches to Spanish language by default. If this happens, test validations will fail since they are written to validate English version of the website.<br> 

If this happens here is instructions on how to fix it:
1. Login to website using valid credentials
2. On the top left side main menu click on the Admin menu
3. Then on the Admin page, top left sub-menu find 'Configuration' menu click on it, its a drop-down menu
4. From the Configuration's drop-down select 'Localization' option
5. From Language drop-down field, select English and Save, exit.
